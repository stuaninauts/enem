<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<a name="about-the-project"></a>
## About The Project
During my period of study to enter the university, I took numerous mock tests for the ENEM (Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio, the National High School Exam in Brazil). Throughout this time, I gathered extensive data from these mock tests. Leveraging this data, I developed a web application written in Python to analyze the results. This project aims to provide insights and identify trends in my performance across different subjects.
